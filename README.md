# Iris Species Classification using Random Forest

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the classification of Iris species using a Random Forest model.  The Iris dataset, a classic in machine learning, contains measurements of sepal and petal dimensions for three different Iris species. This project aims to build a robust model capable of accurately predicting the species based on these features, showcasing a practical application of supervised learning techniques.  Understanding this model's performance and limitations provides valuable insights into the capabilities and challenges of machine learning in real-world scenarios.

## Business or Research Problem Statement

The goal is to develop a reliable and accurate model that can automatically classify Iris species based on sepal and petal measurements. This capability could be applied in botanical research, automated species identification systems, or educational demonstrations of machine learning algorithms.  The problem is framed as a multi-class classification task.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used is the famous Iris dataset.  

* **Source:** The dataset is publicly available and commonly used in machine learning tutorials and examples.  (Specific source link if available should be added here)
* **Features:** The dataset contains four features: 'sepal length (cm)', 'sepal width (cm)', 'petal length (cm)', and 'petal width (cm)'.
* **Target Variable:** The target variable is 'target', representing the Iris species (0, 1, or 2).
* **Size:** The dataset consists of 150 samples.
* **Preprocessing:** Minimal preprocessing was performed. The data was loaded directly from the CSV file.  No handling of missing values was necessary as the dataset is complete.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed using visualizations (histograms, scatter plots etc -  *add details and ideally link to visualizations in the `images` folder*).  Key insights from the EDA should be described here. For example,  the EDA might have revealed strong correlations between petal length and petal width,  and clear separation of species based on these features. (Add more specific EDA findings).


## Modeling Approach

A Random Forest Classifier from the `scikit-learn` library was chosen for this project. Random Forests are known for their robustness, ability to handle high dimensionality, and relatively low susceptibility to overfitting.  The decision to use a Random Forest was based on its suitability for this multi-class classification problem and its generally good performance.  Hyperparameter tuning (if performed) should be detailed here.


## Performance Metrics

The model achieved perfect accuracy (100%).

## Results & Interpretation

The Random Forest model achieved perfect classification accuracy on the Iris dataset. This indicates that the model is able to perfectly distinguish between the three Iris species based on the provided features. However, it's important to note that this result might be due to the simplicity and well-structured nature of the Iris dataset.  The model's performance on more complex or noisy datasets might differ.

## Limitations

* The model's performance is evaluated only on the provided Iris dataset.  Its generalizability to other datasets is unknown.
* The dataset is relatively small and simple.  Performance on larger and more complex datasets might be different.
* No extensive hyperparameter tuning was done, potentially limiting the model's optimal performance.


## Future Work

* Evaluate the model's performance on a larger and more diverse dataset.
* Perform a more thorough hyperparameter tuning using techniques like grid search or randomized search.
* Explore other classification algorithms to compare their performance with the Random Forest.
* Investigate feature engineering techniques to potentially improve model performance.
* Add a user interface for easier interaction with the model.
